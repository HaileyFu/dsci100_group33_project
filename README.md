# Tennis Player Ranking prediction model
Our tennis player ranking prediction model leverages both linear regression and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression to deliver robust and precise forecasts. By combining the simplicity and interpretability of linear regression with the flexibility and accuracy of KNN regression, our model effectively captures the intricate patterns and factors influencing player performance. This dual approach ensures a comprehensive analysis, offering a powerful tool for predicting future rankings based on historical performance data.
